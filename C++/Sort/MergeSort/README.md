The **time complexity** of Merge Sort is **O(n log n)** in all cases (best, average, and worst), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Here's why:

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

1. **Divide Step**:
   - The array is recursively divided into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.
   - This division process takes **O(log n)** time because the array is halved at each level of recursion, and there are approximately `log₂ n` levels.

2. **Merge Step**:
   - At each level of recursion, the merging process takes **O(n)** time because all `n` elements are processed to merge the two sorted halves.
   - Since there are `log₂ n` levels, the total time for merging is **O(n log n)**.

---

### **Space Complexity**
- Merge Sort requires additional space for the temporary arrays used during the merging process.
- The **space complexity** is **O(n)** because the algorithm uses auxiliary arrays proportional to the size of the input array.

### **Summary of Complexity**
| Complexity | Big O Notation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n log n) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) |

---

### **Why O(n log n)?**
- The `log n` factor comes from the number of recursive divisions (halving the array).
- The `n` factor comes from the merging process, which processes all `n` elements at each level of recursion.

### **Advantages of Merge Sort**
1. **Stable Sort**: Merge Sort preserves the relative order of equal elements.
2. **Consistent Performance**: It always performs in **O(n log n)** time, regardless of the input distribution.
3. **Suitable for Large Data Sets**: Merge Sort is efficient for large datasets and is often used in external sorting (e.g., sorting data that doesn't fit in memory).

---

### **Disadvantages of Merge Sort**
1. **Extra Space**: It requires additional space proportional to the input size, which can be a drawback for memory-constrained systems.
2. **Slower for Small Data Sets**: For small datasets, simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort may perform better due to lower overhead.

### **Comparison with Other Sorting Algorithms**
| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)             |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n)         |
| Heap Sort       | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(1)             |
| Bubble Sort     | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |

Merge Sort is a great choice when stability and consistent performance are important, especially for large datasets.
